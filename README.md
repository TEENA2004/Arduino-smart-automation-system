## Project 1 – Distance Based Automation

### Overview
This system uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect object distance and automatically trigger an output device based on predefined distance conditions.

### Working Principle
The ultrasonic sensor continuously measures the distance of nearby objects.  
When an object is detected within a specific range, the Arduino activates the connected output device automatically.

## Project 2 – Temperature Based Fan Automation

### Overview
This system uses a DHT11 sensor to monitor temperature and automatically control a fan.

### Working Principle
The DHT11 sensor measures temperature.  
When the temperature exceeds a predefined threshold value, the Arduino turns the fan ON automatically.
