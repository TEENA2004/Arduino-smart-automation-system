### Project 1 – Automatic Light and Temperature Based Control System Using LDR and DHT11 Sensor

### Working Principle:
This project automatically controls lighting and temperature-based devices using sensor data.
The LDR (Light Dependent Resistor) detects ambient light intensity.
When the surroundings become dark, the system automatically turns ON the light.
The DHT11 sensor measures temperature and humidity.
If the temperature exceeds a predefined threshold, the cooling device (fan) is activated automatically.
This system improves energy efficiency and enables smart environmental monitoring.

## Components Used:

1. Arduino Uno
2. LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)
3. DHT11 Temperature & Humidity Sensor
4. LED Bulb
5. DC Fan
6. Resistors
7. Jumper Wires
8. Breadboard
9. Power Supply

### Project 2 – Smart Object Detection and Environment Control System Using LDR and Ultrasonic Sensor

## Working Principle:
This project integrates object detection and automatic lighting control.
The Ultrasonic sensor detects objects by calculating distance using sound waves.
If an object is detected within a specific range, the system activates a device or alert mechanism.
The LDR sensor detects surrounding light levels.
Based on light intensity, the system automatically turns the lighting ON or OFF.
This project demonstrates smart automation and real-time environmental control.

## Components Used:

1. Arduino Uno
2. Ultrasonic Sensor (HC-SR04)
3. LDR (Light Dependent Resistor)
4. LED
5. Resistors
6. Jumper Wires
7. Breadboard
8. Power Supply
