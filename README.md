Arduino Smart Automation System
Project 1 – Distance Based Automation
Overview

This system uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect object distance and trigger automation based on predefined conditions.

Working Principle

The ultrasonic sensor measures distance.
When an object is detected within a specific range, the Arduino activates the connected output device.
