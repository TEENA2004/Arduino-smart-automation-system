Arduino Smart Automation System
Project 1 – Distance Based Automation
Overview

This system uses an ultrasonic sensor to detect object distance and trigger automation based on predefined conditions.

Working Principle

The ultrasonic sensor measures distance.
When an object is detected within a specific range, the Arduino activates the connected output device.

## Project 2 – Temperature Based Fan Automation

### Overview
This system uses a DHT11 sensor to monitor temperature and automatically control a fan.

### Working Principle
The DHT11 sensor measures temperature.  
When the temperature exceeds a predefined threshold value, the Arduino turns the fan ON automatically.
